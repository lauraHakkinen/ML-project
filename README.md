# ML-project
A project I created for Machine Learning course

In my machine learning project I created an optimal model to predict sea ice extent in the Northern Hemisphere. 

I used data from Kaggle.com and processed it using scikit-learn - NumPy and Pandas.

I used different regression models (Polynomial Regression and Ridge Regression) and analyzed the results to find the final model.
